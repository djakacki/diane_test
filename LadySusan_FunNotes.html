               forward to the hour when I shall be admitted into your delightful retirement.</p><p>I long
               to be made known to your dear little children, in whose hearts I shall be very eager
               to secure an interest. I shall soon have need for all my fortitude, as I am on the
               point of separation from my own daughter. The long illness of her dear father
               prevented my paying her that attention which duty and affection equally dictated, and
               I have too much reason to fear that the governess to whose care I consigned her was
               unequal to the charge. I have therefore resolved on placing her at one of the best
               private schools in town, where I shall have an opportunity of leaving her myself in
               my way to you. I am determined, you see, not to be denied admittance at <a href=""class="mentionedlocation">Churchhill</a>.
               It would indeed give me most painful sensations to know that it were not in your

Lady Susan lies to everyone but reveals her true motivations in these spicy Regency texts to her BFF.">Mrs. Johnson</a>. <a href=""class="letterlocation">Langford.</a><p>You were mistaken, my dear <a href="" class="mentionedcharacter">Alicia</a>, in supposing me fixed at this place for the rest
               of the winter: it grieves me to say how greatly you were mistaken, for I have seldom
               spent three months more agreeably than those which have just flown away. At present,
               nothing goes smoothly; the females of the family are united against me. You foretold
               how it would be when I first came to <a href=""class="mentionedlocation">Langford</a>, and <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman" title="Mainwaring is a married man. While staying at his family's home, Lady Susan really puts on a show of flirting with him to the point that his wife eventually kicks her out.">Mainwaring</a> is so uncommonly
               pleasing that I was not without apprehensions for myself. I remember saying to
               myself, as I drove to the house, “I like this man, pray Heaven no harm come of it!”
               But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in mind my being only four months a
               widow, and to be as quiet as possible: and I have been so, my dear creature; I have
               admitted no one’s attentions but <a href="" class="mentionedcharacterman">Mainwaring’s</a>. I have avoided all general flirtation
               whatever; I have distinguished no creature besides, of all the numbers resorting
               hither, except <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman" title="Sir James is dumb and rich. Lady Susan works her charms on him in an elaborate plot to make him marry her daughter Frederica [more on her shortly]. This plan does not work out.">Sir James Martin</a>, on whom I bestowed a little notice, in order to
               detach him from <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter">Miss Mainwaring</a>; but, if the world could know my motive there they
               would honour me. I have been called an unkind mother, but it was the sacred impulse
               of maternal affection, it was the advantage of my daughter that led me on; and <a href="" title="The first of many digs from Lady Susan to her teenage daughter who, granted, has all the personality of a potted plant.">if
               that daughter were not the greatest simpleton on earth,</a> I might have been rewarded
               for my exertions as I ought.</p><p><a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Sir James</a> did make proposals to me for <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter">Frederica</a>; but
               <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter">Frederica</a>, <a href="" title="Burn No. 2">who was born to be the torment of my life,</a> chose to set herself so
               violently against the match that I thought it better to lay aside the scheme for the
               present. I have more than once repented that I did not marry him myself; and were he
               but one degree less contemptibly weak I certainly should: but I must own myself
               rather romantic in that respect, and that riches only will not satisfy me. The event
               of all this is very provoking: <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Sir James</a> is gone, <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter" title="Maria is Mainwaring's sister">Maria</a> highly incensed, and <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter" title="Mrs. Mainwaring is the wife of Mr. Mainwaring, the man with whom Lady Susan has openly flirted">Mrs. Mainwaring</a> insupportably jealous; so jealous, in short, and so enraged against me,
               that, in the fury of her temper, I should not be surprized at her appealing to her
               guardian, if she had the liberty of addressing him: but there <a href="" class="mentionedcharacterman" title="Lady Susan is referring to Mr. Johnson, her BFF's husband. She's gesturing to a time when Mr. Johnson was the guardian of Mrs. Mainwaring and he shunned her because she married Mr. Mainwaring against his wishes.

               a sad state; no house was ever more altered; the whole party are at war, and
               <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mainwaring</a> scarcely dares speak to me. It is time for me to be gone; I have therefore
               determined on leaving them, and shall spend, I hope, a comfortable day with you in
               town within this week. If I am as little in favour with <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman" title="This introduces an important fact: Mr. Johnson HATES Lady Susan, which is awkward seeing as his wife is her best friend.">Mr. Johnson</a> as ever, you must
               come to me at <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">10 Wigmore street</a>; but I hope this may not be the case, for as <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Johnson</a>, with all his faults, is a man to whom that great word “respectable” is
               always given, and I am known to be so intimate with his wife, his slighting me has an

               resource. Were there another place in <a href="" class="mentioned location">England</a> open to me I would prefer it. <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Charles Vernon</a> is my aversion; and I am afraid of his wife.

               becomes a little more reasonable. She will made good connections there, as the girls
               are all of the best families. The price is immense, and much beyond what I can ever

Anyway, they hate each other. It also doesn't help that they have beef because when Mrs. Vernon and Mr. Vernon were getting together, Lady Susan forcefully tried to break them up.">Mrs. Vernon</a> to <a href="" class="receiver" title="Lady De Courcy is Mrs. Vernon's mom.">Lady De Courcy.</a><a href=""class="letterlocation">Churchhill</a><br/>
      <br/> <a href="" class="salute">My dear Mother,</a>
               <br/> <br/>—I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in our power to keep our promise of spending our Christmas with you; and we are prevented that happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to make us any amends. <a href="" class="mentionedcharacter">Lady Susan</a>, in a letter
               to her brother-in-law, has declared her intention of visiting us almost immediately;
               and as such a visit is in all probability merely an affair of convenience, it is
               impossible to conjecture its length. I was by no means prepared for such an event,
               nor can I now account for her ladyship’s conduct; <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">Langford</a> appeared so exactly the
               place for her in every respect, as well from the elegant and expensive style of
               living there, as from her particular attachment to <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Mainwaring</a>, that I was very
               far from expecting so speedy a distinction, though I always imagined from her
               increasing friendship for us since her husband’s death that we should, at some future
               period, be obliged to receive her. <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Vernon</a>, I think, was a great deal too kind to
               her when he was in <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">Staffordshire</a>; her behaviour to him, independent of her general
               character, has been so inexcusably artful and ungenerous since our marriage was first
               in agitation that no one less amiable and mild than himself could have overlooked it
               all; and though, as his brother’s widow, and in narrow circumstances, it was proper
               to render her pecuniary assistance, I cannot help thinking his pressing invitation to
               her to visit us at <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">Churchhill</a> perfectly unnecessary. Disposed, however, as he always
               is to think the best of everyone, her display of grief, and professions of regret,
               and general resolutions of prudence, were sufficient to soften his heart and make him
               really confide in her sincerity; but, as for myself, I am still unconvinced, and
               plausibly as her ladyship has now written, I cannot make up my mind till I better
               understand her real meaning in coming to us. You may guess, therefore, my dear madam,
               with what feelings I look forward to her arrival. She will have occasion for all
               those attractive powers for which she is celebrated to gain any share of my regard;
               and I shall certainly endeavour to guard myself against their influence, if not
               accompanied by something more substantial. She expresses a most eager desire of being
               acquainted with me, and makes very gracious mention of my children but I am not quite
               weak enough to suppose a woman who has behaved with inattention, if not with
               unkindness, to her own child, should be attached to any of mine. <a href="" class="mentionedcharacter">Miss Vernon</a> is to be
               placed at a school in <a href="" class=mentionedlocation">London</a> before her mother comes to us which I am glad of, for
               her sake and my own. It must be to her advantage to be separated from her mother, and
               a girl of sixteen who has received so wretched an education, could not be a very
               desirable companion here. <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman" title="Oh, Reginald. He is Mrs. Vernon's hot brother. He'll be the cub to Lady Susan's cougar.">Reginald</a> has long wished, I know, to see the captivating

He is wrong.">Mr. De Courcy </a>to <a href="" class="receiver">Mrs. Vernon. </a><a href=""class="letterlocation">Parklands.</a><br/><br/><a href="" class="salute">My dear Sister,</a><p>—I congratulate you and <a href="" class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Vernon</a> on being about to receive into your
               family the most accomplished coquette in <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">England</a>. As a very distinguished flirt I
               have always been taught to consider her, but it has lately fallen in my way to hear
               some particulars of her conduct at <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">Langford</a>: which prove that she does not confine
               herself to that sort of honest flirtation which satisfies most people, but aspires to
               the more delicious gratification of making a whole family miserable. By her behaviour
               to <a href="" class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Mainwaring</a> she gave jealousy and wretchedness to his wife, and by her
               attentions to a young man previously attached to <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Mainwaring</a>’s sister deprived an
               amiable girl of her lover.</p><p>I learnt all this from <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Smith</a>, now in <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">this neighbourhood</a> (I have dined with him, at <a href=""class="mentionedlocation">Hurst and Wilford</a>), who is just come from
               <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">Langford</a> where he was a fortnight with her ladyship, and who is therefore well
               qualified to make the communication.</p><p>What a woman she must be! I long to see her, and
               shall certainly accept your kind invitation, that I may form some idea of those
               bewitching powers which can do so much—engaging at the same time, and in the same
               house, the affections of two men, who were neither of them at liberty to bestow
               them—and all this <a href="" title="she's, like, two years older than me">without the charm of youth</a>! I am glad to find <a href="" class="mentionecharacter">Miss Vernon</a> does not
               accompany her mother to <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">Churchhill</a>, as she has not even manners to recommend her;
               and, according to <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Smith</a>’s account, is equally dull and proud. Where pride and
               stupidity unite there can be no dissimulation worthy notice, and <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter">Miss Vernon</a> shall be
               consigned to unrelenting contempt; but by all that I can gather <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter">Lady Susan</a> possesses
               a degree of captivating deceit which it must be pleasing to witness and detect. I
               shall be with you very soon, and am ever, </p><a href="" class="salute">Your affectionate brother,</a><br/><a href="" class="signed">R. DE COURCY.</a></p>
    <p><h1>V</h1><a href="" class="writer">Lady Susan Vernon</a> to <a href=""class="receiver">Mrs. Johnson.</a><a href=""class="letterlocation">Churchhill.</a><p>I received your note, my dear <a href="" class="mentionedcharacter">Alicia</a>, just before I left town, and rejoice to be
               assured that <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Johnson</a> suspected nothing of your engagement the evening before. It
               is undoubtedly better to deceive him entirely, and since he will be stubborn he must
               be tricked. I arrived here in safety, and have no reason to complain of my reception
               from <a href="" class="mentionedcharacterman">Mr. Vernon</a>; but I confess myself not equally satisfied with the behaviour of his
               lady. She is perfectly well-bred, indeed, and has the air of a woman of fashion, but
               her manners are not such as can persuade me of her being prepossessed in my favour. I
               wanted her to be delighted at seeing me. I was as amiable as possible on the
               occasion, but all in vain. She does not like me. To be sure, when we consider that I
               did take some pains to prevent my brother-in-law’s marrying her, this want of
               cordiality is not very surprizing, and yet it shows an illiberal and vindictive
               spirit to resent a project which influenced me six years ago, and which never
               succeeded at last.</p><p>I am sometimes disposed to repent that I did not let <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Charles</a> buy
               <a href= "" class="mentionedlocation">Vernon Castle</a>, when we were obliged to sell it; but it was a trying circumstance,
               especially as the sale took place exactly at the time of his marriage; and everybody
               ought to respect the delicacy of those feelings which could not endure that my
               husband’s dignity should be lessened by his younger brother’s having possession of
               <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">the family estate</a>. Could matters have been so arranged as to prevent the necessity of
               our leaving <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">the castle</a>, could we have lived with <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Charles</a> and kept him single, I
               should have been very far from persuading my husband to dispose of it elsewhere; but
               <a href="" class="mentionedcharacterman">Charles</a> was on the point of marrying <a href="" class="mentionedcharacter">Miss De Courcy</a>, and the event has justified me.
               Here are children in abundance, and what benefit could have accrued to me from his
               purchasing <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">Vernon</a>? My having prevented it may perhaps have given his wife an
               unfavourable impression, but <a href="" title="a classic Austen witticism! put it on a mug! make millions!">where there is a disposition to dislike, a motive will
               never be wanting</a>; and as to money matters it has not withheld him from being very
               useful to me. <a href="" title="lmao">I really have a regard for him, he is so easily imposed upon!</a> The house
               is a good one, the furniture fashionable, and everything announces plenty and
               elegance. <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Charles</a> is very rich I am sure; when a man has once got his name in a
               banking-house he rolls in money; but they do not know what to do with it, keep very
               little company, and never go to <a href="" class="mentionedlocation">London</a> but on business. We shall be as stupid as
               possible. I mean to win my sister-in-law’s heart through the children; I know all
               their names already, and am going to attach myself with the greatest sensibility to
               one in particular, a young <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Frederic</a>, whom I take on my lap and sigh over for his dear
               uncle’s sake.</p><p>Poor <a href=""class="mentionedcharacterman">Mainwaring</a>! I need not tell you how much I miss him, how
               perpetually he is in my thoughts. I found a dismal letter from him on my arrival
               here, full of complaints of his wife and sister, and lamentations on the cruelty of
               his fate. I passed off the letter as his wife’s, to <a href=""class="mentionedcharacter">the Vernons</a>, and when I write to
               him it must be under cover to you.</p><a href="" class="salute">Ever yours,</a><br/><a href="" class="signed">S. VERNON.</a></p>
